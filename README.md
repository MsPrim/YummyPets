Nov 8 2025: Started the project up again after taking a break to do school work!! I first planned out the game a bit more on a quick game design document. Then, I went into the engine and added folers to organise all of the assets that will go into the game and tweaked the game engine's settings to make sure they're compatible with mobile.  I also added cinemachine and textmesh. I added some placeholder art I quickly made, some placeholder art is from SaveMyTree. Made the game look nice.

Nov 9 2025: I added the pet stats such as hunger, energy and happyness to make the pet feel more alive!! The stats go down every 5 seconds for now.
